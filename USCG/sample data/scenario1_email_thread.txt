Subject: RE: Q2 FY28 Quarterly Award Nominations - Alpha Company Issue

SSgt Rodriguez,

Alpha Company's CO, Capt Martinez, is requesting an extension until Monday, 25 March due to field training exercise completion delays. Their Marines just returned from the field yesterday and need time to compile documentation.

Additionally, Bravo Company has submitted two NCO nominations instead of one - both GySgt Thompson and SSgt Garcia. Both have exceptional records from the recent deployment. Should we ask them to select one or can we process both?

Also need clarification on the Marine of the Quarter age limit - one nominee is 19 years old, just checking if there are any restrictions.

V/R,
LCpl Johnson

Subject: RE: Q2 FY28 Quarterly Award Nominations - Command Guidance

S-1 Team,

After discussing with Battalion Commander:

1. Alpha Company extension APPROVED until COB 25 March - field ops take priority
2. Bravo Company must select ONE NCO nomination per regulations
3. No age restrictions for Marine of the Quarter - 19 is acceptable
4. Add requirement: All nominations must include PT scores from last PFT/CFT

SSgt Rodriguez - ensure all companies are aware of the PT score requirement immediately. This will affect the scoring matrix.

Also, Regiment wants digital submissions only this quarter - no hard copies to be processed.

BZ on staying ahead of this timeline.

- Marine of the Quarter: LCpl Davis, Anthony (300 PFT/295 CFT, expert rifle)
