Subject: RE: Q2 FY28 Quarterly Award Nominations - Station Boston Issue

Chief Rodriguez,

Station Boston's OIC, LCDR Martinez, is requesting an extension until Monday, 25 March due to SAR operations completion delays. Their crews just returned from extended patrol yesterday and need time to compile documentation.

Additionally, Station Gloucester has submitted two Petty Officer nominations instead of one - both PO1 Thompson and PO2 Garcia. Both have exceptional records from the recent hurricane response. Should we ask them to select one or can we process both?

Also need clarification on the Coast Guardsman of the Quarter age limit - one nominee is 19 years old, just checking if there are any restrictions.

V/R,
SN Johnson

Subject: RE: Q2 FY28 Quarterly Award Nominations - Command Guidance

Admin Team,

After discussing with Sector Commander:

1. Station Boston extension APPROVED until COB 25 March - SAR ops take priority
2. Station Gloucester must select ONE Petty Officer nomination per regulations
3. No age restrictions for Coast Guardsman of the Quarter - 19 is acceptable
4. Add requirement: All nominations must include scores from last PFT

Chief Rodriguez - ensure all units are aware of the PFT score requirement immediately. This will affect the scoring matrix.

Also, District wants digital submissions only this quarter - no hard copies to be processed.

BZ on staying ahead of this timeline.

Subject: RE: Q2 FY28 Quarterly Award Nominations - Cutter Escanaba Update

Team,

Cutter Escanaba submissions received and reviewed:
- Coast Guardsman of the Quarter: SN Davis, Anthony (excellent PFT, expert marksman)
- Petty Officer of the Quarter: PO2 Ramirez, Sofia (outstanding PFT, boat coxswain, completed college courses)

Sector Operations is having issues with their digital submission system. Tech support ticket #2028-0847 submitted to IT. They may need the hard copy exception.

Question: Should we start preparing the award ceremony presentation slides now, or wait until selections are finalized?

Current status:
- Station Boston: Extension until 25 March
- Station Gloucester: Pending single PO selection
- Cutter Escanaba: Complete
- Sector Operations: Technical issues, pending

V/R,
PO3 Stevens
