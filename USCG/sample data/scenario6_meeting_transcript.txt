AGENDA ITEM 1: Q2 FY28 PROMOTION RECOMMENDATIONS

LtCol Mitchell: Good afternoon, Marines. We're here to review promotion recommendations for Q2 FY28. Capt Williams, please present the Lance Corporal to Corporal recommendations.

Capt Williams: Ma'am, we have eight Lance Corporals eligible for promotion to Corporal. I'll start with the top three recommendations:

1. LCpl Anthony Davis, Alpha Company - TIS 2 years, 4 months. Perfect PFT score, expert rifle qualification, completed online college courses. His platoon sergeant reports exceptional leadership during the recent field exercise.

2. LCpl Sofia Ramirez, Bravo Company - TIS 2 years, 6 months. 295 PFT, expert rifle, currently squad leader in training. Volunteered for additional duties during deployment prep.

3. LCpl Kevin Park, Charlie Company - TIS 2 years, 3 months. 285 PFT, sharpshooter rifle, completed Corporal's Course early. Strong mentorship of junior Marines.

SSgt Rodriguez: Ma'am, all three have clean record books, no negative counselings, and positive feedback from their chain of command.

GySgt Thompson: I've worked with LCpl Davis personally. His initiative during the logistics exercise was outstanding. He identified a supply chain issue that could have delayed training.

Maj Chen: What about the remaining five candidates?

Capt Williams: Sir, LCpl Jackson from Weapons Company is close but needs improvement on his PFT score - currently at 265. LCpl Foster has excellent technical skills but leadership assessment shows need for development. The others are recommended for promotion in Q3 after addressing minor administrative issues.

AGENDA ITEM 2: CORPORAL TO SERGEANT RECOMMENDATIONS

LtCol Mitchell: Moving to Sergeant recommendations. GySgt Thompson?

GySgt Thompson: Ma'am, we have five Corporals eligible. Two standout candidates:

1. Cpl Brandon Miller, Alpha Company - TIS 3 years, 8 months. Led a 12-Marine squad during deployment. 290 PFT, expert rifle, completed Sergeant's Course with distinction. His innovation in maintenance procedures saved the company significant time and resources.

2. Cpl Emma Johnson, HQ Company - TIS 4 years, 1 month. S-1 section leader, managed personnel actions for 400+ Marines with zero errors. 285 PFT, expert rifle, pursuing bachelor's degree. Recommended by both company and battalion level leadership.

MSgt Garcia: Both Corporals have shown exceptional performance in leadership positions. Cpl Miller's tactical knowledge is superior, while Cpl Johnson's administrative skills are crucial for operations.

LtCol Mitchell: Any concerns about either candidate?

SSgt Rodriguez: No concerns, ma'am. Both have consistently exceeded standards and shown growth potential for senior NCO positions.

AGENDA ITEM 3: TIMELINE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS

Capt Williams: Ma'am, promotion board results need to be submitted to Regiment by March 25th. Ceremonies are scheduled for April 5th during the battalion formation.

All recommended Marines have been counseled on expectations and responsibilities of their new ranks. We've prepared promotion warrants and updated the promotion tracking system.

LtCol Mitchell: Excellent. I want personal congratulations letters prepared for each promoted Marine, and ensure their families are invited to the ceremony.

AGENDA ITEM 4: PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT DISCUSSIONS

Maj Chen: We should discuss professional development opportunities for the promoted NCOs. Sergeant's Course availability and advanced training options.

GySgt Thompson: The new Sergeants should be considered for advanced schools - Cpl Miller for infantry tactics course, Cpl Johnson for personnel administration certification.

LtCol Mitchell: Agreed. SSgt Rodriguez, coordinate with career planners for school opportunities.
