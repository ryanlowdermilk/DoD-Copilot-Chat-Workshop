AGENDA ITEM 1: Q2 FY28 ADVANCEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

CDR Mitchell: Good afternoon, team. We're here to review advancement recommendations for Q2 FY28. LT Williams, please present the Seaman to Petty Officer Third Class recommendations.

LT Williams: Ma'am, we have eight Seamen eligible for advancement to Petty Officer Third Class. I'll start with the top three recommendations:

1. SN Anthony Davis, Station Charleston - TIS 2 years, 4 months. Excellent PFT score, expert marksman, completed online college courses. His boat coxswain reports exceptional performance during the recent hurricane response.

2. SN Sofia Ramirez, Cutter James - TIS 2 years, 6 months. Outstanding PFT, expert marksman, currently serving as acting boat crew leader. Volunteered for additional duties during SAR operations.

3. SN Kevin Park, Sector Operations - TIS 2 years, 3 months. Very good PFT, sharpshooter, completed advancement training early. Strong mentorship of junior Coast Guardsmen.

CPO Rodriguez: Ma'am, all three have clean service records, no negative counselings, and positive feedback from their chain of command.

SCPO Thompson: I've worked with SN Davis personally. His initiative during the hurricane evacuation operations was outstanding. He identified a communications issue that could have delayed rescue operations.

LCDR Chen: What about the remaining five candidates?

LT Williams: Sir, SN Jackson from Station Georgetown is close but needs improvement on his PFT score. SN Foster has excellent technical skills but leadership assessment shows need for development. The others are recommended for advancement in Q3 after addressing minor administrative issues.

AGENDA ITEM 2: PETTY OFFICER THIRD CLASS TO PETTY OFFICER SECOND CLASS RECOMMENDATIONS

CDR Mitchell: Moving to Petty Officer Second Class recommendations. SCPO Thompson?

SCPO Thompson: Ma'am, we have five Petty Officers Third Class eligible. Two standout candidates:

1. PO3 Brandon Miller, Station Charleston - TIS 3 years, 8 months. Led a 6-person boat crew during multiple SAR cases. Outstanding PFT, expert marksman, completed leadership course with distinction. His innovation in maintenance procedures saved the station significant time and resources.

2. PO3 Emma Johnson, Sector Operations - TIS 4 years, 1 month. Administration section leader, managed personnel actions for 200+ Coast Guardsmen with zero errors. Very good PFT, expert marksman, pursuing bachelor's degree. Recommended by both station and sector level leadership.

CWO2 Garcia: Both Petty Officers have shown exceptional performance in leadership positions. PO3 Miller's operational knowledge is superior, while PO3 Johnson's administrative skills are crucial for operations.

CDR Mitchell: Any concerns about either candidate?

CPO Rodriguez: No concerns, ma'am. Both have consistently exceeded standards and shown growth potential for senior petty officer positions.

AGENDA ITEM 3: TIMELINE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS

LT Williams: Ma'am, advancement board results need to be submitted to District by March 25th. Ceremonies are scheduled for April 5th during the sector formation.

All recommended Coast Guardsmen have been counseled on expectations and responsibilities of their new rates. We've prepared advancement certificates and updated the personnel tracking system.

CDR Mitchell: Excellent. I want personal congratulations letters prepared for each advanced Coast Guardsman, and ensure their families are invited to the ceremony.

AGENDA ITEM 4: PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT DISCUSSIONS
