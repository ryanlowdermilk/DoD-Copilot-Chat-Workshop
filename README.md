## Overview

This repository provides structured workshop guides for each branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, demonstrating six core Copilot capabilities through real-world garrison scenarios. Each workshop is tailored to branch-specific operations, terminology, and organizational structures while maintaining consistent learning objectives across all services.

## Workshop Capabilities

Each service-specific workshop demonstrates these six Copilot capabilities:

1. **Language Understanding & Generation** - Email summarization, drafting, and tone adjustment
2. **Reasoning & Decision Support** - Analysis, conflict resolution, and recommendation frameworks
3. **Data Analysis & Visualization** - Pattern detection, insights generation, and chart suggestions
4. **Automation & Orchestration** - Workflow design, logic optimization, and process automation
5. **Search & Retrieval** - Information extraction, organization, and consolidation
6. **Personalization & Context Awareness** - Adaptive content, terminology adjustment, and role-specific outputs

## Target Audience

- **Skill Level:** L100-L200 (beginner to intermediate)
- **Environment:** In garrison at military installations, focusing on administrative, operational, and logistical duties

## Workshop Format

- **Duration:** 3 hours per service workshop
- **Structure:** 6 independent scenarios (20-25 minutes each)
- **Approach:** Hands-on, proctor-guided with progressive prompt building
- **Classification:** UNCLASSIFIED
- **Technical Environment:** Standalone Copilot Chat with Microsoft 365 applications (no web grounding or integrated features)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft 365 E5 license (DoD-compliant)
- Access to standalone Copilot Chat (web browser or app)
- DoD-approved versions of M365 applications (Outlook, Word, Excel, Power Automate, Power BI, Teams)
- NIPRNet or equivalent secure network access

### For Proctors

1. Navigate to your service branch folder (USA, USAF, USMC, USN, or USSF)
2. Review the proctor guide for detailed facilitation instructions
3. Verify technical environment setup per prerequisites
4. Prepare sample datasets (templates provided in service folders)
5. Test copy/paste workflows between Copilot Chat and M365 apps

### For Participants

1. Complete pre-work orientation (5-10 minutes) on Copilot Chat interface
2. Ensure access to required M365 applications
3. Familiarize yourself with your service's staff structure and terminology

## Key Learning Techniques

### Progressive Prompt Building

Each scenario guides participants through 4 iterations:
1. **Basic Prompt:** Simple, generic request
2. **Add Context:** Include service-specific details and location
3. **Add Specificity:** Define structure, format, and expected outputs
4. **Final Optimized Prompt:** Incorporate regulations, priorities, and complete requirements

### Meta-Prompting

Teaching Copilot to help refine prompts:
```
Help me create an effective prompt to [task]. What [service-specific] details should I include?
```

### Chain of Reasoning

Breaking complex tasks into logical steps:
```
Let's work through this step by step: 1) [analyze], 2) [identify], 3) [recommend], 4) [output]
```
