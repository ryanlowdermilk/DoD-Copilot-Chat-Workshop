AGENDA ITEM 1: BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP PRIORITIES - Q2 2028

Ambassador Henderson: Good morning, everyone. Let's begin with political-economic priorities for the quarter. Jennifer, please start with the political landscape.

Political Counselor Martinez: Madam Ambassador, we're tracking three major developments. First, the French government is finalizing its defense white paper revision, expected publication mid-April. Our initial read suggests increased defense spending - potentially 2.3% of GDP by 2030, exceeding NATO's 2% target.

Second, upcoming legislative elections in June may shift parliamentary dynamics. Current polling shows the governing coalition maintaining majority but with reduced margins. This could affect ratification of pending bilateral agreements.

Third, France continues positioning as EU leader on strategic autonomy issues, particularly technology and defense industrial cooperation. This creates both opportunities and friction points with Washington.

DCM Chang: On the strategic autonomy question - how does this impact our ongoing negotiations on technology sharing and export controls?

Economic Counselor Kim: Sir, it's creating tension. French industry is pressing their government to maintain China export relationships while also wanting access to U.S. technology partnerships. The Ministry of Economy is trying to balance commercial interests against security concerns we've raised through the TTC framework.

We have a critical juncture coming up - the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council meeting in May. Paris wants to showcase EU-U.S. cooperation, but there are unresolved issues on semiconductors, AI governance, and data privacy standards.

Ambassador Henderson: What's our recommendation on messaging?

Economic Counselor Kim: Madam Ambassador, I recommend we emphasize areas of alignment - climate technology, infrastructure investment, joint research on quantum computing. Use these wins to build capital for tougher conversations on export controls and critical technology protection.

AGENDA ITEM 2: CONSULAR OPERATIONS AND RESOURCE CHALLENGES

Consular Chief Anderson: Ma'am, consular section is facing significant visa demand increases. We're processing 15% more applications than last quarter - primarily student visas for the fall semester and business travel recovering to pre-pandemic levels.

Current wait time for tourist visa interviews is 47 days, which is drawing complaints from the French government and impacting bilateral perceptions. We've received three diplomatic notes in the past month expressing concern about delays affecting French citizens' travel to the U.S.

DCM Chang: What's driving the backlog? Staffing or system constraints?

Consular Chief Anderson: Both, sir. We're down two consular officers - one on medevac, another on home leave. Additionally, the new security vetting procedures from Washington are adding approximately 8 days per application for clearance processing.

Management Counselor Williams: We've submitted staffing requests to replace the medevac position, but the Bureau hasn't approved backfill authority yet. In the interim, I recommend we explore creative scheduling - extended interview hours, Saturday appointments for urgent cases.

Ambassador Henderson: Approved. Mark, coordinate with David on the logistics. Also, I want a diplomatic note response drafted addressing the French government's concerns while explaining our security requirements. Lisa, work with Mark on public messaging to manage expectations.

AGENDA ITEM 3: SECURITY ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT

Defense Attaché Colonel Johnson: Ma'am, the security environment remains stable with no direct threats to post. However, we're monitoring several developments:

First, increased cyber activity targeting Western diplomatic missions across Europe. No successful penetrations of our systems, but RSO and I recommend heightened awareness, especially around major diplomatic events.

Second, protest activity around climate and economic issues continues. We expect demonstrations during the upcoming G7 preparatory meetings in April. Coordination with French security services is excellent.

Third, we've seen uptick in suspicious surveillance of embassy facilities and personnel residences. Nothing actionable yet, but establishing pattern analysis with RSO.

Ambassador Henderson: Are we confident in our security posture for the G7 prep events?

Defense Attaché Colonel Johnson: Yes, Ma'am. We've conducted tabletop exercises with RSO and French authorities. Our procedures are solid. Recommend we limit embassy footprint at external G7 venues and rely on French security there, while maintaining robust protection here.

AGENDA ITEM 4: PUBLIC DIPLOMACY AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS

Public Affairs Officer Thompson: Madam Ambassador, we've had a productive quarter on public diplomacy. Key highlights:

Our social media engagement increased 23% - particularly strong performance on education and cultural exchange content. The Ambassador's recent university visit in Lyon generated significant positive coverage.

However, we're also tracking concerning disinformation trends. A coordinated campaign is spreading false narratives about U.S. intentions in Africa and the Pacific. We're working with the French government's disinformation task force to counter these narratives, but it's resource-intensive.

Looking ahead, we have opportunities around the D-Day anniversary commemorations in June. I recommend the Ambassador participate in multiple events to reinforce the U.S.-France historical partnership and contemporary alliance strength.

Ambassador Henderson: Agreed. What support do you need for counter-disinformation work?

Public Affairs Officer Thompson: Ma'am, primarily Arabic and French language capacity. If we could get a temporary duty assignment from another post with those skills for 60-90 days, that would significantly enhance our capability.

DCM Chang: I'll work with you on a TDY request. We might be able to coordinate with Embassy Dakar or Rabat.

AGENDA ITEM 5: MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCE ISSUES

Management Counselor Williams: Madam Ambassador, three items for your awareness:

First, we're 68% through the fiscal year budget with 71% obligated - slightly behind pace but manageable. The consular operation expansion will require reprogramming funds from other areas. I'll provide options by next week.

Second, our facility assessment identified needed upgrades to the chancery HVAC system - estimated $2.8 million. This exceeds our maintenance budget authority, so we'll need to request supplemental from OBO.

Third, we're implementing new telework policies per the Department's updated guidance. This is causing some friction with locally employed staff expectations. HR is conducting information sessions to manage the transition.

Ambassador Henderson: On the HVAC - what's the timeline if we don't get supplemental funding?

Management Counselor Williams: Ma'am, the system is functional but inefficient. We're seeing 30% higher energy costs and reliability concerns. If we defer, we risk a major failure that could disrupt operations and cost more in emergency repairs.

Ambassador Henderson: Understood. Let's make the OBO request a priority. I'll engage with the bureau on Congressional notification requirements.

ADDITIONAL ITEMS DISCUSSED:

- Coordination for upcoming CODEL visit in April
- French participation in regional security initiatives
- Cultural exchange program expansion

NEXT MEETING: April 4, 2028 for pre-CODEL coordination

Ambassador Henderson: Excellent work, everyone. A few closing thoughts: First, we're entering a critical period with G7 prep, the CODEL visit, and the TTC meeting. Our work directly supports not just bilateral relations but broader U.S. interests in Europe.

Second, I appreciate the creativity on resource challenges. We'll continue advocating for what we need, but also finding solutions with what we have.

Third, remember we're a team. The political-economic work supports consular services, security enables all our operations, public diplomacy reinforces policy objectives. Each section's success contributes to mission success.

Thank you for your dedication to representing American interests and values in France.

Meeting adjourned at 1030.
