Subject: RE: Priority Visa Applications - Case WRS2028-4589 Documentation Issue

Ms. Miller,

Case WRS2028-4589 (student visa) has incomplete documentation. The applicant, Jan Kowalski, submitted I-20 from University of Michigan but missing:
- Financial support documentation (bank statements or sponsor letter)
- English proficiency test scores (TOEFL/IELTS)
- Academic transcripts from previous institution

I contacted the applicant via email requesting documents by COB March 20. However, they indicated difficulty obtaining bank statements until March 23 due to their bank's processing delays.

Should we:
1. Schedule interview for March 23 (after holiday, pushing to March 26)?
2. Request expedited documentation from the bank?
3. Accept alternative proof of financial support?

Also, case WRS2028-4567 (business visa) has a security clearance delay. The applicant has a common name flagging multiple database matches. Estimated clearance: March 21, which meets our deadline but is cutting it close.

Question: For the business visa, the trade delegation sponsor requested expedited processing. Is this eligible under our emergency appointment criteria?

Respectfully,
David Chen, GS-9
Consular Associate
U.S. Embassy Warsaw

Subject: RE: Priority Visa Applications - Guidance and Approvals

Consular Team,

After reviewing the cases with DCM:

1. Case WRS2028-4589 (Kowalski student visa): APPROVED for March 26 interview. Accept sponsor letter from U.S. institution in lieu of bank statements if university confirms full scholarship/funding. Verify with EducationUSA advisor if needed.

2. Case WRS2028-4567 (business delegation): APPROVED for expedited security clearance coordination with RSO. This qualifies under economic diplomacy priorities per recent Department guidance. Schedule interview March 22 pending clearance.

3. All applications must include fraud prevention review per recent consular cable 28STATE012345 - additional scrutiny on financial documents.

David - Work with RSO on accelerated name-check resolution for the business visa applicant. Copy me on the status update by COB today.

Maria - Send me update on the J-1 and B-2 cases by noon. We need to ensure no delays given the medical emergency aspect of the B-2.

Also, reminder: Post received notice of increased interview wait times due to staffing. We need to explore options for additional interview slots. Sarah, let's discuss resource allocation in our 1400 meeting today.

Well done on managing the workload during this busy period.

Robert Thompson, FSO-1
