## Lab Overview

This guide provides proctors with a structured framework to facilitate a 3-hour hands-on lab for US Air Force personnel on leveraging standalone Copilot Chat. The lab focuses on six independent real-world scenarios, each highlighting a unique Copilot capability integrated with Microsoft 365 applications in a DoD environment.

### Training Objectives
- Demonstrate how standalone Copilot Chat enhances productivity in USAF operational tasks without relying on integrated M365 Copilot features or web grounding.
- Teach progressive prompt building to optimize Copilot outputs for USAF-specific contexts.
- Build skills in copying/pasting between Copilot Chat and M365 apps for secure, compliant workflows.
- Highlight meta-prompting and chain of reasoning techniques for advanced usage.
- Ensure participants understand Copilot's role in A-staff focus areas like manpower, operations, logistics, communications, and intelligence.

### Target Audience Description

- Sample data files/templates for each scenario (e.g., mock email threads, datasets).
- Projector for demonstrating steps if needed.
- Secure DoD network environment.

### Timing Breakdown
- ⏱️ Introduction: 10-15 minutes
- ⏱️ Each Scenario: 20-25 minutes (including setup, steps, and discussion)
- ⏱️ Breaks: 10 minutes between scenarios 3 and 4
- ⏱️ Wrap-up: 10-15 minutes
